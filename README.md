### Question 1: Calc Quantity of items, Sales value & Order quantity by each Subcategory in L12M
``````sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH from SOD.ModifiedDate) Month,
    EXTRACT(YEAR from SOD.ModifiedDate) Year,
    FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%b %Y', SOD.ModifiedDate) AS Period,
    PPS.Name,
    SUM(OrderQty) AS Qty_item,
    SUM(LineTotal) AS Total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT SalesOrderID) AS Order_cnt
FROM
    adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail SOD
LEFT JOIN
    adventureworks2019.Production.Product PP 
        ON SOD.ProductID = PP.ProductID
LEFT JOIN
    adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory PPS
        ON PPS.ProductSubcategoryID = CAST(PP.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT)
WHERE CAST(SOD.ModifiedDate AS DATE) >= (
        SELECT 
            DATE_SUB(CAST(MAX(ModifiedDate) AS DATE), INTERVAL 12 MONTH)
        FROM
